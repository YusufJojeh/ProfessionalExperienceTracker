# Read Functionality Fixes - Professional Experience Tracker

## Overview
Fixed the "read" functionality in the admin navigation to ensure all "View" buttons work correctly and provide proper access control.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Broken "View" Link in Manage Users**

**Problem**: The "View" button in `manage_users.php` was pointing to `profile.php?user=<?php echo $user['id']; ?>` but the `profile.php` file didn't handle viewing other users' profiles.

**Solution**: Enhanced `profile.php` to support viewing other users' profiles with proper access control.

#### **Changes Made to `profile.php`:**

1. **Added User Parameter Handling**:
   ```php
   // Get user data - check if viewing own profile or another user's profile
   $viewing_user_id = isset($_GET['user']) ? (int)$_GET['user'] : $_SESSION['user_id'];
   
   // If viewing another user's profile, check if current user is admin
   if ($viewing_user_id != $_SESSION['user_id']) {
       if (!isset($_SESSION['role']) || $_SESSION['role'] !== 'admin') {
           header('Location: dashboard.php');
           exit();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Added Access Control**:
   ```php
   // Check if current user can edit this profile
   $can_edit = ($viewing_user_id == $_SESSION['user_id']) || (isset($_SESSION['role']) && $_SESSION['role'] === 'admin');
   ```

3. **Enhanced Form Security**:
   ```php
   // Handle form submission
   if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && $can_edit) {
       // Only allow editing if user has permission
   ```

4. **Dynamic Form Rendering**:
   - **Read-only Mode**: When viewing another user's profile, all form fields are read-only
   - **Edit Mode**: When viewing own profile or as admin, form fields are editable
   - **Visual Indicators**: Added badge to show when viewing another user's profile

5. **Updated Navigation**:
   - **Viewing Own Profile**: "Back to Dashboard" button
   - **Viewing Other User**: "Back to Users" button

#### **Form Field Updates**:
```php
// All form fields now check $can_edit
<input type="text" class="form-control" name="full_name" 
       value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($user['full_name']); ?>" 
       <?php echo $can_edit ? 'required' : 'readonly'; ?>>
```

### 2. **Fixed Button Text in Manage Users**

**Problem**: The "View" button was showing "Edit" text, which was confusing.

**Solution**: Updated button text to clearly indicate "View" functionality:
```php
<a href="profile.php?user=<?php echo $user['id']; ?>" class="btn btn-outline btn-sm">
    <i class="fas fa-eye"></i> <?php echo $lang === 'en' ? 'View' : 'عرض'; ?>
</a>
```

### 3. **Verified Project View Functionality**

**Status**: ✅ **Already Working Correctly**

The "View" button in `manage_projects.php` was already working properly:
```php
<a href="project.php?id=<?php echo $project['id']; ?>" class="btn btn-outline btn-sm" title="<?php echo $current_content['view']; ?>">
    <i class="fas fa-eye"></i>
</a>
```
