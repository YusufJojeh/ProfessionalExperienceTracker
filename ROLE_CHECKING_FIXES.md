# Role Checking Fixes - Professional Experience Tracker

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes made to ensure proper role checking during login and throughout the application for both admin and user roles.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Login.php - Missing Role Field in Query
**Problem**: The login authentication was not fetching the user's role from the database.

**Before**:
```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id, username, email, password FROM users WHERE email = ?");
```

**After**:
```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id, username, email, password, full_name, role FROM users WHERE email = ?");
```

### 2. Login.php - Missing Role in Session
**Problem**: The user's role was not being stored in the session after successful login.

**Before**:
```php
$_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];
$_SESSION['user_name'] = $user['name'];  // Incorrect field name
$_SESSION['user_email'] = $user['email'];
```

**After**:
```php
$_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];
$_SESSION['user_name'] = $user['full_name'];  // Correct field name
$_SESSION['user_email'] = $user['email'];
$_SESSION['role'] = $user['role'];  // Added role to session
```

### 3. Login.php - Role-Based Redirect
**Problem**: All users were redirected to dashboard.php regardless of their role.

**Before**:
```php
header('Location: dashboard.php');
```

**After**:
```php
// Redirect based on role
if ($user['role'] === 'admin') {
    header('Location: admin.php');
} else {
    header('Location: dashboard.php');
}
```

### 4. Config/database.php - Inconsistent Session Variable
**Problem**: The `is_admin()` function was checking for `$_SESSION['user_role']` but login was setting `$_SESSION['role']`.

**Before**:
```php
function is_admin() {
    return isset($_SESSION['user_role']) && $_SESSION['user_role'] === 'admin';
}
```

**After**:
```php
function is_admin() {
    return isset($_SESSION['role']) && $_SESSION['role'] === 'admin';
}
```

### 5. Register.php - Missing Role in Session
**Problem**: New users were not having their role set in the session after registration.

**Before**:
```php
$_SESSION['user_id'] = $user_id;
$_SESSION['user_name'] = $name;
$_SESSION['user_email'] = $email;
```

**After**:
```php
$_SESSION['user_id'] = $user_id;
$_SESSION['user_name'] = $name;
$_SESSION['user_email'] = $email;
$_SESSION['role'] = 'user'; // Default role for new users
```

## Session Variables Used

The application now consistently uses these session variables:

- `$_SESSION['user_id']` - User's unique identifier
- `$_SESSION['user_name']` - User's full name
- `$_SESSION['user_email']` - User's email address
- `$_SESSION['role']` - User's role ('user' or 'admin')

## Role Checking Implementation

### Admin Access Control
All admin pages now have proper role checking at the top:

```php
// Check if user is logged in and is admin
if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id']) || (isset($_SESSION['role']) && $_SESSION['role'] !== 'admin')) {
    header('Location: login.php');
    exit();
}
```

### Admin Pages with Role Checking
- `admin.php` - Main admin dashboard
- `manage_users.php` - User management
- `manage_projects.php` - Project management
- `manage_categories.php` - Category management
- `platform_settings.php` - Platform settings

### Navigation Role Checking
- `user_nav.php` - Shows admin panel link only for admin users
- `admin_nav.php` - Comprehensive admin navigation

## Testing

A test script `test_role_checking.php` has been created to verify:
- Session variables are set correctly
- Role checking functions work properly
- Database user roles are accessible
- Appropriate navigation links are shown based on role

## Database Schema

The `users` table includes a `role` field:
```sql
role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user'
```

## Security Features

1. **Role-based Access Control**: Admin pages are protected from unauthorized access
2. **Self-deletion Prevention**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
3. **Session-based Authentication**: All pages check for valid session
4. **Role-based Navigation**: UI adapts based on user role

## Usage

### For Admin Users:
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Automatically redirected to admin.php
3. Access to all admin management features
4. Admin panel link visible in user navigation

### For Regular Users:
1. Login with user credentials
2. Automatically redirected to dashboard.php
3. Access to user features only
4. No admin panel access

## Files Modified

1. `login.php` - Fixed authentication and role handling
2. `config/database.php` - Fixed is_admin() function
3. `register.php` - Added role to session for new users
4. `test_role_checking.php` - Created test script (new file)

## Files Already Properly Configured

1. `admin.php` - Admin access control
2. `manage_users.php` - Admin access control
3. `manage_projects.php` - Admin access control
4. `manage_categories.php` - Admin access control
5. `platform_settings.php` - Admin access control
6. `user_nav.php` - Role-based navigation
7. `admin_nav.php` - Admin navigation

## Conclusion

The role checking system is now fully functional and secure. Users are properly authenticated and redirected based on their role, and all admin pages are protected from unauthorized access.
